# Overview

I was not able to test and build a functionnal application with my allowed time and ressource so i simply designed an basic app with the pattern and the library i know. i don't think this app will work correctly but i can explain myself about the right way to make it work with proper architecture / pattern / test and features.

TODO

Create GalleryViewModel to load data from album

Unit Test & E2E Test with mocked API Service
